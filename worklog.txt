      fails to match testcases.

      addT was checked to ensure that it escaped 'text' answer before curling backend.
      addT and the autograder is ready to be coordinated together for further testing.

  are associated with the proper question when sent to the autograder. last test
  shows that exec will fail if the student answer function does not match the testcases.

  [-] task A -- when exec fails, mark it for failure, and deduct points.

  tested the autograder with testId 2 with 2 questions and it failed

  [-] reports

     task A report - Sun Mar 31 08:27:54 EDT 2019

        the issue was found in getAnswers(). it is not clearning the
	array for each question, thus adding testcases to previous 
	array. clearing it for every loop and conducting test again.

  [-] task A -- ensure that addT prevents inadvertent inserts of invalid
  questions. 

  [-] report A -- addT (MakeTest2.php) will now filter question Ids. It will 
  still create the test, but no questions will be associated with it, 
  it will return an error in its JSON response.
